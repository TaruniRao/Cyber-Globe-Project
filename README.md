# Cyber-Globe-Project 
Network traffic visualization plays a vital role in analyzing data flow, detecting anomalies, and 
optimizing performance. This project proposes a Google Maps-based visualization system 
that maps real-time network traffic data, including IP addresses, latency, and bandwidth 
usage, to provide a geographical representation of traffic patterns. By integrating the Google 
Maps API, the system enhances network security, facilitates troubleshooting, and improves 
decision-making in various domains, including cybersecurity and network management. 
Unlike existing solutions that offer only basic geolocation-based mapping, this project 
incorporates Heatmap-based Anomaly Detection, Real-time Threat Alerts, and Geofencing for 
Network Security to improve monitoring and threat detection. These enhancements enable 
better situational awareness and more effective cybersecurity monitoring.
